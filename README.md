# Flexhire Prototype Application

Welcome to the Flexhire Mobile Application! This application is designed to help you showcase your technical skills while working with the Flexhire using React Native

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## What You Will Be Building

Project Structure: The project consists of different screens or components, which may include the Profile and Jobs screens.
API: You have an API implemented using Ruby on Rails.
Error Handling: If the Ruby on Rails application is not running or encounters an error, the Profile and Jobs screens should display an error message to inform the user of the issue.
ngrok Address: When the Ruby on Rails application is running successfully, it provides an ngrok address. Ngrok is a tool that allows you to expose your local development server to the internet with a public URL.
